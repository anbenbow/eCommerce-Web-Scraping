 eCommerce-Web-Scraping

What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?
    I am still having trouble getting multiple rows and pages to scrape. Currently only scraping the first row.
What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?
    No insight gained with a small amount of data. The three laptops that scraped all had the same number of reviews and different prices. Unablle to determine any connection at this time.
